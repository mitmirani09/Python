#Q.3 Usage of negative numbers as index

""" In python we have an extra feature of negative indexing 
unlike most programming languages. The negative indexing is indexing
from the end of the list with indexing starting at -1 that is 
-1 gives the last element of the list,-2 gives the second last element 
and so on. The use of negative indexing can be done to display data from
the end of the list and can also be used to reverse a number or string without 
using other functions."""
